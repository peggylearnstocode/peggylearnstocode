- 👋 Hi, my name is Peggy Lee. I am from Singapore. 
- 👀 I’m interested in data analytics and machine learning. 
- 🌱 I’m currently building my data analytics tool box. I have self-learned SQL, Python, Tableau and Statistics. All of which are essential to a data analyst. I am enjoying every moment that was spent on learning and refining these skills. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to become a data analyst in the new future.
